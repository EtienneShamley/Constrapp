# Deployment

What exists today: a Vite static build and **two manually published rules files**
— `frontend/firestore.rules` and `frontend/storage.rules` — plus a
**`frontend/firebase.json` scoped to the Firestore and Storage emulators and
those two rules paths** (for the Security Rules test suites — see
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)). **Not implemented:** `.firebaserc`, Firebase Hosting
configuration, Cloud Functions, and CI deployment — all future work.

**Do not run `firebase deploy`.** No `.firebaserc` exists, so no Firebase project
is targeted, and `firebase.json` declares no hosting or functions target. Rules
publishing remains **manual** (below); `firebase.json` exists so
`firebase emulators:exec` can run the rules tests locally, not to enable deploys.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Firebase project with **Authentication** (Email/Password), **Firestore**, and
  — since the Documents & Drawings foundation — **Cloud Storage** enabled.
  (Hosting is not set up.) See *Enabling Cloud Storage* below: enabling it in the
  console installs a permissive starter ruleset that **must** be replaced with
  `frontend/storage.rules` in the same sitting.
- Users provisioned manually: an Auth user plus a matching `users/{uid}`
  document — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Environment Variables

Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and fill in the Firebase
web app config (Console → Project settings → Your apps → SDK setup):

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | `apiKey` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | `authDomain` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | `projectId` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `storageBucket` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | `messagingSenderId` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | `appId` |

These are read by `frontend/src/lib/firebase.js`. `.env.local` is git-ignored —
never commit it. (A root-level `.env.example` also exists with a few extra placeholders the
app never reads; the frontend one is canonical.)

## Build

All commands run from `frontend/` — the repository root has no `package.json`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build     # outputs static site to frontend/dist/
npm run preview   # serve the build locally
```

`frontend/dist/` can be served by any static host. No hosting target is
configured yet.

## Publishing Firestore Rules — Manual Process

The rules source of truth is `frontend/firestore.rules`, but **there is no CLI
wiring to deploy it** (no `.firebaserc`, so no project is targeted). Publishing is
manual:

1. Edit `frontend/firestore.rules` in the repo (review against
   [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).
2. **Run `npm run test:rules`** and confirm it passes — the emulator suite loads
   this exact file (see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) §0).
3. Open Firebase console → Firestore Database → **Rules**.
4. Paste the full file contents over the editor content.
5. **Publish.**

Keep the console and the repo file identical — the repo copy is the reviewed
artifact; the console copy is what actually enforces.

### ⚠️ ORDERING GATE — application code first, rules second (ADR-40)

Rules and application code are versioned together in this repo but **published
separately**, so a rules change that requires a NEW FIELD must not reach the
console before the code that writes it. Publishing out of order is an outage,
not a rollback-able mistake: every write the old bundle issues is rejected with
"Missing or insufficient permissions" until the new bundle is live.

**One such gate is outstanding.** The ADR-40 `supplierInvoices` block requires
`updatedAt` / `updatedBy` on every write and `cancelledBy` on a cancellation.
Supplier-invoice writes issued before ADR-40 send **none of those three**, so:

1. Deploy the application build containing `hooks/useSupplierInvoices.jsx` first.
2. Confirm the deployed bundle is live and a supplier invoice can be created,
   edited, approved, posted and cancelled against the CURRENT (pre-ADR-40) rules
   — the new fields are additive, so the old rules accept them.
3. Only then publish `frontend/firestore.rules`.

Reversing those steps breaks **create, draft edit, approve, post and cancel** on
the Supplier Invoices register for every user until the build catches up.

The general rule: **if a rules change adds a required field, the code that writes
it ships first.** Existing documents are unaffected either way — the ADR-40
block reads `cancelledBy` through `get(key, null)` on both sides and requires the
audit stamps only of the INCOMING document, so a pre-ADR-40 invoice stays
editable and acquires the new fields on its next valid write.

## Enabling Cloud Storage — Manual Process (one time)

Documents & Drawings stores file bytes in Cloud Storage. Until Storage is
enabled **and** `frontend/storage.rules` is published, every upload fails and the
app reports *"File storage is not set up for this Firebase project yet."*

⚠️ **The order matters.** Enabling Storage installs Google's starter ruleset,
which is far more permissive than this app's. Do not upload anything — not even
a test file — between enabling Storage and publishing `storage.rules`.

1. Firebase console → **Build → Storage → Get started**.
2. When prompted for a rules mode, choose **production mode** (deny-all) rather
   than test mode. Test mode grants open read/write for 30 days.
3. Accept the **default bucket** (`<projectId>.appspot.com` or
   `<projectId>.firebasestorage.app`, depending on project vintage) and pick a
   location **in the same region as Firestore**. ⚠️ The bucket location is
   **permanent** and cannot be changed afterwards.
4. Confirm the bucket name matches `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` in
   `frontend/.env.local` (Console → Project settings → Your apps → SDK setup →
   `storageBucket`). If they differ, update `.env.local` and rebuild — the app
   resolves its bucket from that variable.
5. Storage → **Rules** → replace the entire editor contents with
   `frontend/storage.rules` → **Publish**.
6. Confirm the published rules contain `service firebase.storage` and the
   `match /{allPaths=**} { allow read, write: if false; }` catch-all, and contain
   **no** `allow read, write: if true` and no `request.time <` date clause.

Run `npm run test:rules` before publishing: the emulator suite loads this exact
file and covers tenant isolation, writer roles, content types, size ceilings and
create-only immutability.

## Publishing Storage Rules — Manual Process (every change)

Identical discipline to Firestore rules:

1. Edit `frontend/storage.rules` (review against [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) →
   *Cloud Storage — the SECOND trust boundary*).
2. **Run `npm run test:rules`** — one command runs both the Firestore and the
   Storage suites against both emulators.
3. Firebase console → **Storage → Rules**.
4. Paste the full file contents over the editor content.
5. **Publish.**

## Future Work (not current functionality)

- `.firebaserc` (and a hosting/functions section in `firebase.json`) so rules
  deploy via `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage`
- Firebase Hosting configuration for the built frontend
- Cloud Functions (server-side enforcement — see
  [PROJECT_DECISIONS.md](PROJECT_DECISIONS.md) ADR-14)
- CI: lint + build + rules deploy on merge
